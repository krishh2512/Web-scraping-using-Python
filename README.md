--Web scraping it's a helpful method to extract information from websites when the website doesn't have a proper API to get it, or simply for have fun getting random content from the web.
--This is something very simple, I thought that someone will find this useful, or at least funny, As I exctract All the Tv shows name and URL and count of seasons and episodes from a Belgian movie database website "http://www.couchtuner.video/"
--A small hint to keep into account:This website uses an anti-DDOS protection services, So you will have to be careful you don't get blocked by this service.
